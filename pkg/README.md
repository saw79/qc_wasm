# Quantum Cortex

This is an experimental rewrite of an Android roguelike game I wrote a few years ago called Quantum Cortex. The old version is written in Java and therefore buggy, inconvenient to maintain, and only available on Android. The purpose of this rewrite is to experiment with Rust/WASM and to make the game available in the browser.

The latest build is playable at [https://saw79.github.io/qc_wasm](https://saw79.github.io/qc_wasm)

(Note: development is extremely early so don't expect much yet)
